:description: Oracle Coherence documentation
:keywords: coherence, java, documentation

Coherence is scalable, fault-tolerant, cloud-ready, distributed platform for building grid-based applications and reliably
storing data. The product is used at scale, for both compute and raw storage, in a vast array of industries such as
critical financial trading systems, high performance telecommunication products, and eCommerce applications. 

Typically, these deployments do not tolerate any downtime and Coherence is chosen due its novel features in death
detection, application data evolvability, and the robust, battle-hardened core of the product that enables it to be seamlessly deployed and 
adapted within any ecosystem.

At a high level, Coherence provides an implementation of the familiar Map<K,V> interface but rather than storing
the associated data in the local process, it is partitioned (or sharded) across a number of designated remote
nodes. This partitioning enables applications to not only distribute (and therefore scale) their storage across multiple processes,
machines, racks, and data centers, but also to perform grid-based processing to truly harness the CPU resources of the
machines. 

The Coherence interface 'NamedCache<K,V>' (an extension of 'Map<K,V>' provides methods to query, aggregate
(map/reduce style), and compute (send functions to storage nodes for locally executed mutations) the data set.
These capabilities, in addition to numerous other features, enable Coherence to be used as a framework to write robust,
distributed applications.
