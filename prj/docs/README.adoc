= Coherence Documentation Module

== Coherence Documentation Module

This is the module that builds the Coherence documentation.
The module is not part of the default build and must be built separately.

=== Build the Docs

To build the docs, run the following Maven command from the top-level `prj/` directory:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests -P docs -pl docs
----

=== View the Docs

To view the documentation after building, run the following command from the top-level `prj/` directory:

[source,shell]
----
mvn exec:exec -P docs -pl docs
----

NOTE: The installation requires you to install Python, which runs a small Pythin http server from the directory into which the docs
are built.
