<h2>Coherence&#8482; API Specification.</h2>

<p>
    Coherence&#8482; is a data management solution for scalable Java applications.
</p>

<p>
    Coherence&#8482; makes sharing and managing data in a cluster as
    simple as on a single JVM using Java Collection classes. It accomplishes
    this by coordinating updates to the data using cluster-wide concurrency
    control, distributing or replicating data modifications across the cluster
    using the highest performing clustered protocol available, and delivering
    notifications of data modifications to any cluster nodes that request them.
    Developers can easily take advantage of Coherence features using the
    standard Java Collection API to access and modify data, and the standard
    JavaBean event model to receive data change notifications.
</p>

    To get started with Coherence&#8482;, please see the JavaDoc for
