== Import a Project Into IntelliJ IDEA

This guide walks you through importing one of the Coherence guides or tutorials into IntelliJ IDEA.

=== What You Will Build

You will pick a Coherence guide or example and import it into IntelliJ IDEA.
Then you can then read and follow the individual guide or tutorial documentation.

==== What You Need
* About 15 Minutes
* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[IntelliJ IDEA]
* https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/[JDK 17] or later

==== Installing IntelliJ IDEA

If you don’t have IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate Edition) installed yet, visit the link up above.
From there, you can download a copy for your platform. To install it simply unpack the downloaded archive.

When you’re done, go ahead and launch IntelliJ IDEA.

==== Clone the Coherence CE Repository

To import an existing project you need to clone the https://github.com/oracle/coherence[Coherence CE repository]
if you have not already done so.

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/coherence.git
----

==== Importing a Guide or Tutorial

1. With IntelliJ IDEA up and running, click `Import Project` on the Welcome Screen, or `File | New Project From Existing Sources`.

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory, then `prj/examples` and then to the guide or tutorial directory.
For example for *Near Caching* you would open `prj/examples/guides/130-near-caching` directory.

3. In the pop-up dialog select either `Maven` or `Gradle` as the external model to import from.

4. Once the project is imported, follow the README to build or run the example or guide.
