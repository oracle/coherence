== Overview

These guides and tutorials are designed to help you be productive as quickly as possible in whatever use-case you
are building with Coherence.
Coherence has a long history and having been around for twenty years its APIs have evolved over that time.
Occasionally there are multiple ways to implement a specific use-case, typically because to remain backwards compatible
with older releases, features cannot be removed from the product. For that reason these guides use the latest Coherence
versions and best practice and approaches recommended by the Coherence team for that version.
