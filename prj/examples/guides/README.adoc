== Guides

These simple guides are designed to be a quick hands-on introduction to a specific feature of Coherence.
In most cases they require nothing more than a Coherence jar and an IDE (or a text editor if you're really old-school).
Guides are typically built as a combination Maven and Gradle project including the corresponding wrappers for those tools
making them simple to build as stand-alone projects without needing to build the whole Coherence source tree.
