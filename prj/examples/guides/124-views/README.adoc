== Views

This guide walks you through the concepts of creating _Views_, also known as _Continuous Queries_. _Views_ allow you to
execute queries against your Coherence data with the added benefit that _Views_ stay up-to-date, allowing you to retrieve
the latest results of your query from the Coherence cache in real-time.

[#what-you-will-build]
=== What You Will Build

The example code is written as a set of unit tests, showing you how can create _Views_ against your
Coherence data.

[#data-model]
=== Example Data Model

The data model for this guide consists of a single class named `Country`. This model class represents a country with the
following properties:

- name
- capital
- population

The data is being stored in a Coherence cache named `countries` with the key being the two-letter
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2[ISO 3166 country code].

[#why-to-use-views]
=== Why to use Views

With _Views_, also referred to as _Continuous Queries_, you can ensure that a query always retrieves the latest results
from a cache in real-time. For instance, in the <<examples/guides/110-queries/README.adoc,queries guide>>, we used a
`Filter` to query for a subset of data from a Coherence cache. However, what happens with the underlying cache if changes
_DO_ happen, and you need the updates immediately? Queries, as used previously, will only retrieve a snapshot
of the underlying data. They will not reflect future data changes. Thus, let's revisit a
<<examples/guides/110-queries/README.adoc#filter,previous example>> that queries a cache containing `Countries` using a `Filter`. The
`Filter`, as in the previous query example, will ensure that only countries with a population of 60 million or more people
are returned.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/queries/ViewTests.java[tag=testGreaterEqualsFilterWithChanges]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> We create a Filter that will select only countries with at least 60 million people using a `GreaterEqualsFilter`
<3> Apply the `Filter` by invoking `entrySet(filter)` on the `NamedCache`
<4> The result should be 2 countries only
<5> We add a new country Mexico to the map
<6> Assert that still only France and Germany were selected

In this test we have added a new country Mexico to the `countries` Map but as you can see, the change will not be
reflected in the already filtered results map. In order to get updates in real-time, we have to use a `ContinuousQueryCache`.

_Views_ are extremely useful in all those situations where we need immediate access to any changes of the underlying data,
such as trading systems or Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems. They can be used in both client-based and server-based
applications and are reminiscent of SQL Views.

[#using-a-continuous-query-cache]
=== Using a ContinuousQueryCache

The following test will look almost exactly the same as the previous test. However, instead of calling the `entrySet()`
method on the `NamedCache`, we will create a new instance of `ContinuousQueryCache` and pass in the `Filter` and the Coherence
map as constructor arguments.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/queries/ViewTests.java[tag=testGreaterEqualsFilterWithContinuousQueryCache]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> We create a `Filter` that will select only countries with more than 60 million people using a `GreaterEqualsFilter`
<3> Create a new instance of `ContinuousQueryCache`
<4> The result should consist of 2 countries only
<5> We add a new country Mexico to the original map
<6> Assert that the `ContinuousQueryCache` now contains 3 countries

Under the covers, the `ContinuousQueryCache` will use Coherence cache events on the map to react to changes in the
Coherence `NamedCache`.

NOTE: In order to create a `ContinuousQueryCache` without filtering, use the `AlwaysFilter`, e.g.
`new ContinuousQueryCache(map, AlwaysFilter.instance)`.

[#observing-continuous-query-caches]
=== Observing Continuous Query Caches

Proactively querying for updates is all fun and games but what if you need to execute logic as soon as data changes
happen? The `ContinuousQueryCache` implements the `ObservableMap` interface to react to Coherence cache events. As such,
you can subscribe to cache events by registering `MapListener` implementations.

In the following test, we will add a `MapListener` to keep track of countries being added to the underlying `NamedCache`.
But because this listener is added to the `ContinuousQueryCache`, the listener will only get invoked for countries
that have a population of 60 million or more.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/queries/ViewTests.java[tag=testContinuousQueryCacheWithListener]
----
<1> Create a counter to keep track of added countries
<2> Instantiate a `MapListener` that will increment the counter for each new country being added
<3> Add the `MapListener` to the `ContinuousQueryCache`
<4> Assert that the `ContinuousQueryCache` contains 2 countries
<5> Add a new country with a population larger than 60 million
<6> Assert that the `ContinuousQueryCache` now contain 3 countries
<7> The counter of the `MapListener` should have increased by 1

[#continuous-aggregation]
=== Continuous Aggregation

What about aggregated results? In an earlier example for Queries, we had used a `Filter` and a `BigDecimalSum` aggregator
to calculate the sum of the population for those countries whose population is at least 60 million.

We can use a `MapListener` to achieve that, as the `ContinuousQueryCache` does not directly support aggregators.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/queries/ViewTests.java[tag=testAggregate]
----
<1> Create a `BigDecimalSum` aggregator. The `IdentityExtractor` will use the actual value (does not actually extract
    anything)
<2> Create a holder for the aggregated population and trigger the initial aggregation explicitly
<3> Instantiate a `MapListener` that will trigger the aggregation of the population for each new country being added
<4> Add the `MapListener` to the `ContinuousQueryCache`
<5> Assert that the aggregated population is initially 150.6 million
<6> Add a new country with a population larger than 60 million
<7> Assert that the `ContinuousQueryCache` now contain 3 countries
<8> The aggregated population should now be 276.61 million

[#summary]
=== Summary

In this guide we showed, how you can easily create _Views_ with a `ContinuousQueryCache` that reflects changes of the data
in the underlying Coherence `NamedCache` in real-time. Please see the Coherence reference guide, specifically the chapter
