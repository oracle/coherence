== CDI Response Caching

CDI Response Caching allows you to cache the results of method invocations.
Each time a target method is invoked, CDI interceptors check whether the method
has already been invoked for the given arguments. If the method has been invoked,
the cached result is returned without invoking the target method again.
If there are no cached results because the method hasn't been invoked yet
or because the result was removed from the cache, the target method is invoked,
the result is cached, and then returned to the caller.

=== What You Will Build

The example code is written as a set of unit tests, showing you how to use
CDI Caching Response annotations.

==== Building the Example Code
include::../../internal/includes/simple-build.adoc[tag=text]

=== Example Data Model

The data model for this guide consists of a single class named `Message`. It
represents a message for a user and has a single property: message.


=== Create the Resource Class and JUnit Test Class

The first step is to create root JAX-RS resource class that will be used to
test the various response caching operations. Resource will be using `messages-cache`
to store cached messages.

[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResource.java[tag=resource]
----

and test class:

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResourceTest.java[tag=testclass]
----
<1> Inject cache so we can verify its content
<2> Reset cache content and counters before each test


=== Response Caching Operations

Let's add resource method and test for each response caching operation:

==== @CacheGet
@CacheGet gets the value from the cache if present; invokes the target method
and caches the result otherwise.

Add resource method to the resource class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResource.java[tag=cacheget]
----
<1> We'll test @CacheGet annotation processing
<2> Cache key will be `name` argument
<3> We'll count number of method invocations
<4> Result of the method invocation that will be cached

Add test method for @CacheGet operation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResourceTest.java[tag=testget]
----
<1> Invoke caching resource method
<2> Verify that response is the expected one
<3> Verify that target method was invoked
<4> Verify that response was cached
<5> Verify that repeated invocation of the caching resource method won't result
in the method execution as result will be returned from the cache


==== @CacheAdd
@CacheAdd always calls the target method and then caches the result.

Add resource method to the resource class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResource.java[tag=cacheadd]
----
<1> We'll test @CacheAdd annotation processing
<2> Cache key will be `name` argument
<3> We'll count number of method invocations
<4> Result of the method invocation that will be cached

Test method for @CacheAdd operation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResourceTest.java[tag=testadd]
----
<1> Populate cache by invoking caching resource method
<2> Invoke resource method annotated with @CacheAdd
<3> Verify that the target method was invoked and its returning value was cached
<4> Invoke @CacheAdd annotated method again
<5> Verify that the target method was executed once again


==== @CachePut
@CachePut stores the value annotated with @CacheValue in the cache and calls the target method

Add resource method to the resource class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResource.java[tag=cacheput]
----
<1> We'll test @CachePut annotation processing
<2> Cache key will be `name` argument and `message` will be new cache value
<3> We'll count number of method invocations
<4> Result of the method invocation that won't be cached

Test method for @CachePut operation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResourceTest.java[tag=testput]
----
<1> Pass new cache value to the caching resource method
<2> Verify that passed value is stored in the cache
<3> Invoke the same @CachePut annotated method again
<4> Verify that the target method was executed once again


==== @CacheRemove
@CacheRemove removes the key from the cache and calls the target method

Add resource method to the resource class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResource.java[tag=cacheremove]
----
<1> We'll test @CacheRemove annotation processing
<2> Cache key to remove from the cache
<3> We'll count number of method invocations
<4> Result of the method invocation that will be returned

Test method for @CacheRemove operation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResourceTest.java[tag=testremove]
----
<1> Store initial value in the cache
<2> Verify that cache is populated
<3> Remove key from the cache by invoking resource method marked with @CacheRemove
<4> Verify that key was removed from the cache


==== @CacheName
The @CacheName annotation defines the cache that will be used for response caching. If both the class and methods are annotated with @CacheName, the value from the method annotation takes precedence.

Add resource method to the resource class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResource.java[tag=cachename]
----
<1> Specify cache name that will override cache name defined on a class (message-cache)


Test method for @CacheName annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResourceTest.java[tag=testname]
----
<1> Populate cache
<2> Verify that cache specified by class @CacheName is not populated
<3> Verify that cache specified by method @CacheName is populated


==== Multiple arguments as a cache key
Unless the @CacheKey annotation is applied to a parameter, all parameters except for one marked with @CacheValue
will be used as a part of the cache key.

Add resource method to the resource class:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResource.java[tag=cacheparams]
----
<1> Cache key will be assembled from both `firstName` and `lastName` arguments.


Test method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/responsecaching/GreetResourceTest.java[tag=testname]
----
<1> Store initial value in the cache
<2> Verify that cache is populated correctly
<3> Verify that value was fetched from the cache


=== Summary

You have seen how to use CDI Caching Response annotations.
