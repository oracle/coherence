== Querying Caches

This guide walks you through the basic concepts of querying Coherence caches. We will provide a quick overview and
examples of using _Coherence Query Language_ (CohQL) before learning more about `Filters`, `ValueExtractors` and `Aggregators`
to query caches programmatically.

=== What You Will Build

The example code is written as a set of unit tests, showing you how can simply executed sophisticated queries against your
Coherence data.

[#the-power-of-cohql]
=== The Power of CohQL

Before we start querying caches programmatically, you should be aware of the power of the _Coherence Query Language_ (CohQL).
CohQL is inspired by SQL and is a quick and easy way to interact with your caches. Commonly it is used as a command-line tool.

Let's assume we have a cache called `countries` that contains a map of `Country` classes with the 2-letter country code
being the key of each cache entry. The `Country` class will have some basic properties such as `name`, `capital` and `population`.

The simplest CohQL query you could write is a query that will return all countries is:

```sql
select * from countries
```

As you can see, if you're familiar with SQL, you will feel right at home. And of course from here we can make the query
more sophisticated.

NOTE: For detailed information on how to use CohQL, please visit the chapter
link:{commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/using-coherence-query-language.html#GUID-C0D082B1-FA62-4899-A043-4345156E6641[Using Coherence Query Language]
in the Coherence reference guide.

In order to give you a way experiment with the cache using CohQL, we provide a simple sample app that pre-populates a Coherence
cache `countries` wih countries and starts the CohQL Console. To get started, execute `com.oracle.coherence.guides.queries.StartCohQLConsole`.

TIP: Typically, you would want to start the CohQL Console as a stand-alone application. Please see the
https://github.com/oracle/coherence#cohql-console[following instructions] to learn more.

Once the console application is started, let's execute:

```sql
select * from countries
```

The result should be a list of 5 countries:

```java
Results
Country{name='Colombia', capital='Bogotá', population=50.4}
Country{name='Australia', capital='Canberra', population=26.0}
Country{name='Ukraine', capital='Kyiv', population=41.2}
Country{name='France', capital='Paris', population=67.4}
Country{name='Germany', capital='Berlin', population=83.2}
```

What if you would like to just retrieve the list of capitals? We can achieve that by selecting just the capital:

```sql
select capital from countries
```

which yields:

```java
Results
"Bogotá"
"Paris"
"Canberra"
"Kyiv"
"Berlin"
```

Of course, you can also apply `where` clauses to further limit the results. For example, if you like to retrieve the
countries with a population that is greater than 60 million you may add the following `where` clause:

```sql
select capital from countries c where population > 60.0
```

which results in:

```java
Results
"Paris"
"Berlin"
```

Another option is to aggregate results. For example, let's calculate the total population of countries with a population
larger than 60 million:

```sql
select sum(population) from countries c where population > 60.0
```

which yields a value of `150.6`.

NOTE: CohQL is not merely a tool for query caches. It can also be used to _create_ and _delete_ caches, to _insert_,
_delete_ and _update_ cache value, to _create indices_ and more. For more information please see the official reference
documentation.

[#query-caches-programmatically]
=== Query Caches Programmatically

So how would we create queries programmatically to retrieve the same results? The key here is to understand the following
concepts:

- link:{javadoc-root}com/tangosol/util/Filter.html[Filter]
- link:{javadoc-root}com/tangosol/util/ValueExtractor.html[ValueExtractor]
- link:{javadoc-root}com/tangosol/util/aggregator/package-summary.html[Aggregator]

[#create-the-test-class]
=== Create the Test Class

The first step is to create the test class that will show and test the various query operations,
we'll call this class `QueryTests`. We will use Junit 5 for this test, so the class does not have to be public.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
class QueryTests {
}
----

[#bootstrap-coherence]
==== Bootstrap Coherence

The first thing the test class will do is start Coherence using the bootstrap API introduced in Coherence `20.12`. As this
is a JUnit test class, we can do this in a static `@BeforeAll` annotated setup method. We will also populate the cache with
several countries and thus let's create a small helper class `CoherenceHelper`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/queries/utils/CoherenceHelper.java[tag=bootstrap]
----
<1> Obtain a default storage enabled cluster member `Coherence` instance.
<2> Start the `Coherence` instance, this wil start all the Coherence services.
<3> Block until Coherence instance has fully started before proceeding with the tests
<4> Obtain the default `Session`
<5> Get the `countries` cache
<6> Populate the `countries` cache with several new `Country` instances

We are going to start a storage enabled cluster member using the most basic bootstrap API methods.
For more details on the bootstrap API see the <<docs/core/02_bootstrap.adoc, corresponding guide>>.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/queries/QueryTests.java[tag=bootstrap]
----
<1> Call `CoherenceHelper` and start the `Coherence` instance and populate the country data.

Lastly, we create a static `@AfterAll` annotated tear-down method that will shut down Coherence at the end of the test.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/queries/QueryTests.java[tag=cleanup]
----
<1> We only created a single default `Coherence` instance, so we can obtain that instance with the
`Coherence.getInstance()` method, and then close it.

Now the basic framework of the test is in place we can add methods to show different querying operations.

[#filter]
==== Filter

To get started, we would like to retrieve all countries that have a population of more than 60 million people. For that
we will use a `Filter`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/queries/QueryTests.java[tag=testGreaterEqualsFilter]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> We create a Filter that will select only countries with more than 60 million people using the `Filters` helper class via `Filters.greaterEqual`. 
<3> Apply the `Filter` by invoking `entrySet(filter)` on the Map
<4> The result should be 2 countries only
<5> Assert that only France and Germany were selected

NOTE: The best practice for ValueExtractors is to use the method reference, e.g. `Country::getPopulation`, to extract falues as this provides compile time type checking.

[#value-extractor]
==== ValueExtractor

What if we don't want to return `Countries` but just the collection of country names for which the population is
60 million people or higher? This is where we can use a `ValueExtractor` in combination with a `ReducerAggregator`.

A value extractor is used to extract a property from a given object. In most instances developers would use the
`ReflectionExtractor` as an implementation. The `ReducerAggregator` on the other hand, is used to run a `ValueExtractor`
against cache entries, and it returns the extracted value. The result returned by the `ReducerAggregator` is a `Map`
where the key is the key of the cache entry and the value is the extracted value.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/queries/QueryTests.java[tag=testValueExtractor]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> We create the same filter as in the previous test (Select countries with more than 60 million people, only)
<3> Create a `ReducerAggregator` instance and specify that we only want the name of the countries returned
<4> Apply the `Filter` and `Aggregator`
<5> Verify that only the two country names `France` and `Germany` are returned as filtered values

[#aggregate-results]
==== Aggregate Results

What if we want to group queried data together? Let's query for countries, where the population is greater than 60
million but instead of returning the countries, we will return the sum of the population of thsoe 2 countries instead.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/queries/QueryTests.java[tag=testAggregator]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> We create the same filter as in the previous test (Select countries with more than 60 million people, only)
<3> We will use a different `Aggregator`. `BigDecimalSum` will aggregate the population and return a `Bigecimal` value. This shows that you can use a method name (not recommended) as well as method reference
<4> Apply the `Filter` and `Aggregator`
<5> For assertion purposes we will convert the `BigDecimal` value to a `String`
<6> The generated String shall not have any trailing zeros
<7> Return the String
<8> Verify that the returned value is `150.6`
