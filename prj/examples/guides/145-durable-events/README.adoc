== Durable Events

Coherence provides the `MapListener` interface as described in <<examples/guides/140-client-events/README.adoc, Client Events>>,
where clients can sign up for events from any Coherence `NamedMap`.  With traditional client events, if a client disconnects for
any reason and then reconnects and automatically re-registers a `MapListener`, it will miss any events that were sent during that disconnected time.

Durable Events is a new (experimental) feature that allows clients to create a versioned listener which will allow
a client, if disconnected, to receive events missed while they were in a disconnected state. As for standard `MapListener`s
you are able to register for all events, events based upon a filter or events for a specific key.

More advanced use cases for Durable Events include the ability to replay all events for a `NamedMap`.

Please see {commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/using-map-events.html#GUID-35236F52-2815-494F-9231-1363B8206AE4[Durable Events Documentation] for more information on Durable Events.

NOTE: Durable events are an experimental feature only and should not be used in production environments.

NOTE: Durable Events are not yet supported for Coherence*Extend clients.

[#what-you-will-build]
=== What You Will Build

In this example you will run a test that will demonstrate using Durable Events. The test does the following:

* Starts 2 Cache Servers using https://github.com/coherence-community/oracle-bedrock[Oracle Bedrock]
* Creates and registers a version aware `MapListener`
* Inserts, updates and deletes cache entries
* Simulates the client being disconnected
* Issues cache mutations remotely while the client is disconnected
* Reconnects the client and validate that events generated while the client was disconnected are received

To enable Durable Events you must have the following system properties set for cache servers:

* Enable active persistence by using `-Dcoherence.distributed.persistence.mode=active`
* Set the directory to store Durable Events using `-Dcoherence.distributed.persistence.events.dir=/my/events/dir`
* Optionally set the directory to store active persistence using `-Dcoherence.distributed.persistence.base.dir=/my/persistence/dir`
* Register a versioned `MapListener` on a `NamedMap`

NOTE: If you do not set the directory to store active persistence the default directory `coherence` off the users home directory will be chosen.

=== Review the Classes

1. Review the `Customer` class
+
This example uses the `Customer` class which has the following fields:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/durableevents/Customer.java[tag=vars]
----

2. Review how the 2 cache servers are started by Oracle Bedrock
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/durableevents/DurableEventsTest.java[tag=startup]
----
<1> Set the partition count to 23 to reduce the startup time
<2> Set active persistence mode
<3> Set the base directory to store persistence files
<4> Set the base directory to store persistence events

3. Review the `DurableEventsTest` class
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/durableevents/DurableEventsTest.java[tag=testDurableEvents]
----
<1> Set system properties for the client
<2> Create a new `SimpleMapListener`
<3> Add an event handler to output the events received
<4> Add an event handler to increment the number of events received
<5> Indicate that this `MapListener` is versioned
<6> Add the `MapListener` to the `NamedMap`
<7> Simulate the client being disconnected by stopping the service for the `NamedMap`
<8> Generate 3 new events remotely on one of the members
<9> Issue an operator that will cause the client to restart and re-register the listener
<10> Assert that we now see the additional 3 events that were generated while the client was disconnected

[#run-example-1]
=== Run the Examples

You can run the test in one of three ways:

* Using your IDE to run `DurableEventsTest` class
* Using Maven via `./mvnw clean verify`
* Using Gradle via `./gradlew test`

After initial cache server startup, you will see output similar to the following:

NOTE: Timestamps have been removed and output has been formatted for easier reading.
