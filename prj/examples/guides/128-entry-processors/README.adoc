== Entry Processors

This guide walks you through the concepts of creating _Entry Processors_. Entry Processors allow you to perform data
grid processing across a cluster. That means without moving cache entries across the wire, you can process one
or more cache entries locally on the storage node.

=== What You Will Build

The example code is written as a set of unit tests, showing how you can use Entry Processors with Coherence.

[#data-model]
=== Example Data Model

The data model for this guide consists of a single class named `Country`. This model class represents a country with the
following properties:

- name
- capital
- population

The data is being stored in a Coherence cache named `countries` with the key being the two-letter
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2[ISO 3166 country code].

[#why-use-entry-processors]
=== Why use Entry Processors?

In our example, we do have several countries loaded into the cache. Let's assume we want to increase the population of
several countries by a million each. More specifically, we only want to increase the population for those countries that
have a population of 60 million or more.

The obvious choice would be to query the cache using a `GreaterEqualsFilter` as we have done in the
<<examples/guides/124-views/README.adoc,previous example on Views>>, iterate over the results and update the respective
countries.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/entryprocessors/EntryProcessorTests.java[tag=testIncreasePopulationWithoutEntryProcessor]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> We create a Filter that will select only countries with at least 60 million people using a `GreaterEqualsFilter`
<3> Apply the `Filter` by invoking `keySet(filter)` on the `NamedCache` that will return a Set of keys
<4> Assert that the `Set` of filtered keys only contains 2 keys
<5> Loop over the keys
<6> Make sure we lock the cache entry
<7> Increment the population by 1 million
<8> Update the map

IMPORTANT: This is an example of how NOT to do this!

While this works, it will be inefficient in use-cases where you have to update high number of cache entries.This approach
would cause a lot of data to be moved over the wire, first for the retrieval of countries and then when pushing the
updated countries back into the cluster.

This is where _Entry Processors_ come into play. Entry Processors allow us to perform data grid processing inside the Coherence
cluster. You can either apply Entry Processors for single cache keys or you can perform parallel processing against a
collection of cache entries (map-reduce functionality).

NOTE: For a more in-depth introduction to Entry Processors, please refer to the respective chapter
link:{commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/processing-data-cache.html#GUID-1CF26403-2922-4514-9395-84BCFF81849B[Processing Data In a Cache]
in the Oracle Coherence reference guide.

[#creating-an-entry-processor]
=== Creating an Entry Processor

Let's rewrite the inefficient example above to use an Entry Processor. First, we will create a class called
`IncrementingEntryProcessor` that implements `InvocableMap.EntryProcessor`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/entryprocessors/IncrementingEntryProcessor.java[tag=IncrementingEntryProcessor]
----
<1> The Entry Processor implements Coherence's `InvocableMap.EntryProcessor` class. The type parameters represent the key, the value
    and the return type of the Entry Processor.
<2> The `process()` method gives us access to the value of the `countries` Map
<3> Increment the population by 1 million
<4> Return the incremented population

The `IncrementingEntryProcessor` contains one method `process()` that provides us with access to the `Country` via
the `InvocableMap.Entry` argument. We will increase the population and the return the population. Now it is time to use
the `IncrementingEntryProcessor`.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/entryprocessors/EntryProcessorTests.java[tag=testIncreasePopulationWithCustomEntryProcessor]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> We create a Filter that will select only countries with at least 60 million people using a `GreaterEqualsFilter`
<3> Call `invokeAll` on the `countries` Map, passing in both the filter and the `IncrementingEntryProcessor`
<4> The result should be the Map containing the key and the new population value for the 2 affected countries

In this example we are processing multiple map entries at once. You can of course apply Entry Processors to single map keys
as well by using:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/entryprocessors/EntryProcessorTests.java[tag=testIncreasePopulationForSingleEntry]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> Call `invoke` on the `countries` Map, passing in the key (instead of the filter) and the `IncrementingEntryProcessor`
<3> The result should be the double value representing the new population value of Germany

[TIP]
====
Before writing your own Entry Processor from scratch, please also check if one of the
link:{commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/processing-data-cache.html#GUID-BEB17FE8-D121-46F5-B401-637AD2AE19C7[built-in Entry Processors]
may already solve your requirement.
====

In the next section we will see how we can simplify the example even further using lambda expressions.

[#lambda-expressions]
=== Using Lambda Expressions

Instead of creating dedicated Entry Processor classes, it may be advisable to pass in lambda expressions instead.
Especially in use-cases such as our very simple contrived example, lambda expressions simplify the code noticeably.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/entryprocessors/EntryProcessorTests.java[tag=testIncreasePopulationUsingLambdaExpression]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> We create a Filter that will select only countries with at least 60 million people using a `GreaterEqualsFilter`
<3> Call `invokeAll` on the `countries` Map passing in the filter and the function that increments the population
<4> The result should be the Map containing the key and the new population value for the 2 affected countries

[#lambda-expressions-single-value]
=== Process Single Map Keys Using Lambda Expressions

When using lambda expressions for single map keys, you can use Coherence's `invoke()` as well as Java's `Map.compute()` method.
Let's see the code for Coherence's `invoke()` method first:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/entryprocessors/EntryProcessorTests.java[tag=testIncreasePopulationUsingInvokeForSingleCountry]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> Call `invoke` on the `NamedCache`, passing the key for Germany and the lambda expression
<3> It is important to explicitly call `setValue` on the cache entry

If using `compute()`, the code will look like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/entryprocessors/EntryProcessorTests.java[tag=testIncreasePopulationUsingComputeForSingleCountry]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> Call `compute` on the `NamedCache`, passing the key for Germany and the lambda expression.
<3> Set the new population but as you can see that there is no need to set the country explicitly on the cache entry.

The code when using `compute` looks a little simpler, as `compute` implicitly updates the value to whatever you return. When
using `invoke`, you have to explicitly call `entry.setValue(country)`. On the other hand, `compute` will return the entire
country, whereas with `invoke` you can return any data object. This is advantageous in situations where you need to
minimize the amount of data passed over the wire.

[#update-all-map-entries]
=== Update all Map Entries

Sometimes we may need to update all entries in a Coherence Map. In that use-case we simply change the passed-in Filter.
The lambda expression on the other hand remains the same. All we need to do is to pass in an instance of the `AlwaysFilter`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/entryprocessors/EntryProcessorTests.java[tag=testIncreasePopulationForAllCountries]
----
<1> Get the `countries` Map
<2> Get an instance of the `AlwaysFilter` that will select all entries in the `countries` Map
<3> Call `invokeAll` on the `countries` Map passing in the `AlwaysFilter` and the function that increments the population
<4> The result should be the Map containing the key and the new population value for all 5 countries in the Map

[#cache-entry-expiration]
=== Specify Cache Entry Expiration

When adding values to a `NamedCache`, without using an Entry Processor, you have the optional ability to also set an
expiration value for the cache value. For example, in the following code snippet, we add a new country with an expiration
value of 5 seconds (Values are specified in milliseconds).

[source,java,indent=0]
----
NamedCache<String, Country> countries = getMap("countries");
Country country = new Country("Germany", "Berlin", 83.2);
countries.put("de", country , 5000);
----

[NOTE]
====
Cache expiration can also be configured per-cache using the `<expiry-delay>` cache configuration element in the
`coherence-cache-config.xml` file.
See link:{commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/configuring-caches.html#GUID-B57A0E9B-23F2-4099-86D7-6DDD54BBC45C[the reference documentation]
for details.
====

You can do the same when mutating cache entries via Entry Processors. Let's update the previous example so that all countries
we are updating will expire within 2 seconds. As the code listed below is very similar to the previous example, we shall
highlight the changes only:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/entryprocessors/EntryProcessorTests.java[tag=testIncreasePopulationForAllCountriesWithExpiration]
----
<1> We need to cast the `InvocableMap.Entry` to a `BinaryEntry`.
<2> `BinaryEntry` has a method `expire` that specifies when the cache entry will expire. We set it to 2 seconds. The parameter is an integer value representing milliseconds.
<3> The returned Map of `invokeAll` will have 5 `countries`. This Map will not "expire".
<4> There should be 5 entries in the `NamedCache` map. The `NamedCache` map will expire.
<5> The Thread will sleep for 4 seconds.
<6> Assert that the returned Map of `invokeAll` still has 5 `countries`
<7> Assert that the `NamedCache` map is empty. The values have expired.

The important piece of information to remember is that the underlying `BinaryEntry` has the relevant property to specify
the expiration of the cache entry, and we need to cast `InvocableMap.Entry` to a `BinaryEntry`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The expiration property is defined as an integer and is expressed in milliseconds. Therefore, the maximum amount of time
cannot exceed approximately 24 days.
