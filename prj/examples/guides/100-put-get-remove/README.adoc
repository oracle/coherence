== Put Get and Remove Operations

This guide walks you through the basic CRUD operations on a Coherence {javadoc-root}com/tangosol/net/NamedMap.html[NamedMap].

=== What You Will Build

The example code is written as a set of unit tests, as this is the simplest way to demonstrate something as
basic as individual `NamedMap` operations.

==== What You Need
:java_version: 1.8
include::../../internal/includes/what-you-need.adoc[tag=text]

==== Building the Example Code
include::../../internal/includes/simple-build.adoc[tag=text]


=== Coherence `NamedMap`

The Coherence {javadoc-root}com/tangosol/net/NamedMap.html[NamedMap] is an extension of Java's `java.util.Map` interface
and as such, it has all the `Map` methods that a Java developer is familiar with. Coherence also has a
{javadoc-root}com/tangosol/net/NamedMap.html[NamedCache] which extends `NamedMap` and is form more transient data
storage in caching use cases.

The most basic operations on a `NamedMap` are the simple CRUD methods, `put`, `get` and `remove`, which this guide
is all about.


=== Create the Test Class

The first step is to create the test class that will show and test the various `NamedMap` operations,
we'll call this class `BasicCrudTest`. We will use Junit 5 for this test, so the class does not have to be public.

[source,java]
----
class BasicCrudTest {
}
----


==== Bootstrap Coherence

The first thing the test class will do is start Coherence using the bootstrap API introduced in Coherence v20.12.
As this is a JUnit test class, we can do this in a static `@BeforeAll` annotated setup method.
We are going to start a storage enabled cluster member using the most basic bootstrap API methods.
For more details on the bootstrap API see the corresponding guide
// ToDo: Add a link to the bootstrap guide here

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/simple/BasicCrudTest.java[tag=bootstrap]
----
<1> Obtain a default storage enabled cluster member `Coherence` instance.
<2> Start the `Coherence` instance, this wil start all the Coherence services.
<3> Block until Coherence instance has fully started before proceeding with the tests

Second, we create a static `@AfterAll` annotated tear-down method that will shut down Coherence at the end of the test.

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/simple/BasicCrudTest.java[tag=cleanup]
----
<1> We only created a single default `Coherence` instance, so we can obtain that instance with the
`Coherence.getInstance()` method, and then close it.

Now the basic framework of the test is in place we can add methods to show different `NamedMap` operations.


==== Obtain a `NamedMap` Instance

All the tests in this guide need to obtain a `NamedMap` instance,
we will use a Coherence {javadoc-root}com/tangosol/net/Session.html[Session] for this.
A `Session` is a means to access Coherence clustered resources.
Creation of `Session` instances is part of the bootstrap API, which we can obtain named `Session` instances from.
In this case we are using the bootstrap API's default, so we can simply obtain the default `Session`.
To get a `NamedMap` from a `Session` we use the `Session.getMap()` method. This take a `String` value, which is
the name of the map to obtain from the `Session`.

There are a number of ways we could have encapsulated this common code in the test class.
In this case we will create a simple utility method to get a `NamedMap` with a give name that the different test
methods can call.
[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/simple/BasicCrudTest.java[tag=get-map]
----
<1> We only created a single default `Coherence` instance, so we can obtain that instance with the
`Coherence.getInstance()` method.
<2> Obtain the default `Session` from the `Coherence` instance.
<3> Obtain and return the `NamedMap` instance with the required name.


=== A Quick Word About Serialization

In almost every case a `NamedMap` is backed by a distributed, clustered, Coherence resource.
For this reason all `Objects` used as keys and values *must* be serializable so that they can be transferred between
cluster members and clients during requests.
Coherence Serialization support is a topic that deserves a guide of its own
// ToDo: Add link to serialization guide.
The {javadoc-root}com/tangosol/io/Serializer.html[Serializer] implementation used by a `NamedMap` is configurable
and Coherence comes with some out of the box `Serializer` implementations.
The default is Java serialization, so all keys and values must be Java `Serializable` or implement Coherence
{javadoc-root}com/tangosol/io/ExternalizableLite.html[ExternalizableLite] interface for more control of serialization.
Alternatively Coherence can also be configured to use Portable Object Format for serialization and additionally
there is a JSON Coherence module that provides a JSON serializer that may be used.

To keep this guide simple we are going to stick with the default serializer, so all `NamedMap` operations will use
classes that are `Serializable`.


=== The Put Method

The obvious place to start is to add data to a `NamedMap` using the `put` method.
We will create a simple test method that uses `put` to add a new key and value to a `NamedMap`.

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/simple/BasicCrudTest.java[tag=put]
----
<1> We call the `getMap` utility method we wrote above to get a `NamedMap` with the name `data`.
In this case the map's keys and values are both of type `String`.

<2> We call the `put` method to map the key `"key-1"` to the value `"value-1"`.
As `NamedMap` implements `java.util.Map`, the `put` contract says that the `put` method returns the previous valued
mapped to the key.

<3> In this case there was no previous value mapped to `"key-1"`, so the returned value must be `null`.

To show that we do indeed get back the old value returned from a `put`, we can write a slightly different test method
that puts a new key and value into a `NamedMap` then updates the mapping with a new value.
[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/simple/BasicCrudTest.java[tag=put-existing]
----


=== The Get Method

We have seen how we can add data to a `NamedMap` using the `put` method, so the obvious next step is to get the data
back out using the `get` method.

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/simple/BasicCrudTest.java[tag=get]
----
<1> We call the `getMap` utility method we wrote above to get a `NamedMap` with the name `data`.
In this case the map's keys and values are both of type `String`.

<2> We add some data to the `NamedMap` mapping the key `"key-3"` to the value `"value-1"`;

<3> We use the `get` method to get the value from the `NamedMap` that is mapped to the key `"key-3"`,
which obviously must be `"value-1"`.

=== Get Multiple Values

The Coherence `NamedMap` contains a {javadoc-root}com/tangosol/net/NamedMap.html#getAll(java.util.Collection)[getAll(java.util.Collection)]
method that takes a collection of keys as a parameter and returns a new `Map` that contains the requested mappings.

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/simple/BasicCrudTest.java[tag=get-all]
----
<1> We call the `getMap` utility method we wrote above to get a `NamedMap` with the name `data`.
In this case the map's keys and values are both of type `String`.

<2> We add some data to the map.

<3> We call the `getAll` method requesting keys `"key-5"`, `"key-7"` and `"key-8"`.

<4> The `result` map returned should only contain two keys, because although we requested the mappings for three keys,
`"key-8"` was not added to the `NamedMap`.

<5> The value mapped to `"key-5"` should be `"value-5"`.

<6> The value mapped to `"key-7"` should be `"value-7"`.


=== The Remove Method

We've now seen adding data to and getting data from a `NamedMap`, we can also remove values mapped to a key with the
`remove` method.

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/simple/BasicCrudTest.java[tag=remove]
----
<1> We call the `getMap` utility method we wrote above to get a `NamedMap` with the name `data`.
In this case the map's keys and values are both of type `String`.

<2> We add some data to the map.

<3> Call the remove method to remove the value mapped to key `"key-9"`.

<4> The contract of the remove method says that the value returned should be the value that was mapped to the key
that was removed (or `null` if there was no mapping to the key). In this case the returned value must be `"value-9"`.


=== The Remove Mapping Method

An alternate version of the `remove` method is the two argument remove method that removes a mapping to a key if the
key is mapped to a specific value.

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/simple/BasicCrudTest.java[tag=remove-mapping]
----
<1> We call the `getMap` utility method we wrote above to get a `NamedMap` with the name `data`.
In this case the map's keys and values are both of type `String`.

<2> We add some data to the map.

<3> Call the remove method to remove the value mapped to key `"key-10"` with a value of `"Foo"`.
This must return `false` as we mapped `"key-10"` to the value `"value-10"`, so nothing will be removed from the `NamedMap`.

<4> Call the remove method to remove the value mapped to key `"key-10"` with a value of `"value-10"`.
This must return `true` as we mapped `"key-10"` to the value `"value-10"`, so the mapping will be removed from the `NamedMap`.


=== `NamedCache` Transient Data

As already stated, a {javadoc-root}com/tangosol/net/NamedMap.html[NamedCache] is typically used to store transient data
in caching use-cases.

The `NamedCache` has an alternative {javadoc-root}com/tangosol/net/NamedCache.html#put(K,V,long)[put(K,V,long)] method
that takes a key, value, and an expiry value. The expiry value is the number of milli-seconds that the key and value
should remain in the cache. When the expiry time has passed the key and value will be removed from the cache.

[source,java]
----
include::src/test/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/simple/BasicCrudTest.java[tag=put-expiry]
----
<1> In the same way that we obtained a `NamedMap` from the default `Session`, we can obtain a `NamedCache`
using the `getCache` method, in this case the cache named `test`.

<2> Using the put with expiry method, we can add a key of `"key-1"` mapped to value `"value-1"` with an expiry of
`2000` milli-seconds (or 2 seconds).

<3> If we now do a `get` for `"key-1"` we should get back `"value-1"` because two seconds has not yet passed
(unless you are running this test on a terribly slow machine).

<4> Now we wait for three seconds to be sure the expiry time has passed.

<5> This time when we get `"key-1"` the value returned must be `null` because the value has expired, and been removed
from the cache.


=== Summary

You have seen how simple it is to use simple CRUD methods on `NamedMap` and `NamedCache` instances, as
well as the simplest way to bootstrap a default Coherence storage enabled server instance.
