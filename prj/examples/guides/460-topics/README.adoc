[#what-you-will-build]
=== What You Will Build

You will review, build and run a simple chat client which showcases using Coherence Topics.
When running the chat client, the user can send a message in two ways:

1. Send to all connected users using a publish/ subscribe model. For this functionality we
create a topic called `public-messages` and all users are anonymous subscribers. Any messages to
this topic will only be received by subscribers that are active.

2. Send a private message to an individual user using a subscriber group. This uses a separate
topic called `private-messages` and each subscriber to the topic specifies their userId as a
subscriber group. Each value is only delivered to one of its subscriber group members, meaning the message will
only be received by the individual user.

NOTE: We do not cover all features in Coherence Topics, so if you wish to read more about Coherence Topics, please see the
{commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/using-topics.html[Coherence Documentation].

[#what-you-need]
=== What You Need
:java_version: 17
include::../../internal/includes/what-you-need.adoc[tag=text]

==== Building the Example Code

Whenever you are asked to build the code, please refer to the instructions below.

include::../../internal/includes/simple-build.adoc[tag=text]

[#review-the-initial-project]
=== Review the Initial Project

[#maven]
==== Maven Configuration

The initial project is a Coherence project and imports the `coherence-bom` and `coherence-dependencies`
POMs as shown below:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=deps1]
----

The `coherence` library is also included:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=deps2]
----

We also define a `server` profile to run one or more DefaultCacheServer processes.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::pom.xml[tag=profile]
----

[#data-model]
==== Data Model

The data model consists of the `ChatMessage` client which contains chat messages sent either on the private or publish topics. The properties are shown below:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatMessage.java[tag=properties]
----

[#cache-config]
==== Topics Cache Configuration

1. The following `topic-scheme-mapping` element is defined in `src/main/resources/topics-cache-config.xml`:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/topics-cache-config.xml[tag=mapping]
----
+
The topics defined are described below:
+
* **public-messages** - contains public messages
* **private-messages** - contains private messages and contains an initial subscriber group named `admin` in configuration.
+
NOTE: Because we have specifically add the `admin` subscriber group in the cache config, this means that
it will be created on startup of the cache server and messages to `admin` will be durable. Messages
for subscriber groups created on the fly, by specifying `Name.of("groupName")` when creating a subscriber,
are only durable from the time the subscribe group is created.

2. The following `caching-schemes` element is defined in `src/main/resources/topics-cache-config.xml`:
+
[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/resources/topics-cache-config.xml[tag=scheme]
----
+
The above `paged-topic-scheme` has no size limit and is automatically started.

[#chat-application]
==== The Chat Application

The chat application is a simple text based client which does the following:

* Starts up with an argument specifying the user id of the user

* Displays a menu, shown below, where a user can send a message to all connected users or privately to an individual.
+
[source,bash]
----
Commands:
quit - Quit the chat
help - Display help
send - Send public message
sendpm userId - Send private message
----

We will examine each of the components in detail below:

1. Topics, Subscribers and Publishers
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatApplication.java[tag=properties]
----

2. System Properties
+
As we are creating a shaded Jar, we are including the following system properties to set the cache configuration file, turn off local storage and reduce the log level.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatApplication.java[tag=systemProperties]
----
+

3. Obtain a Coherence session
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatApplication.java[tag=sessionCreate]
----
+

4. Create the *public* Topic, Subscribers and Publishers
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatApplication.java[tag=public]
----
+
<1> Creates a publisher to publish messages to the topic
<2> Creates a subscriber (anonymous) to receive all messages published to the topic

5. Create the *private* Topic, Subscribers and Publishers
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatApplication.java[tag=private]
----
+
<1> Creates a publisher to publish messages to the topic
<2> Creates a subscriber with a subscriber group of the user to receive private messages

6. When the application starts, two subscriptions are initiated. One to receive messages from the public topic and one
to receive messages from the private topic.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatApplication.java[tag=subscribers]
----
+
NOTE: We are just using the default ForkJoin pool for this example but handleAsync can accept and `Executor` which would be better practice.

7. Each of the above subscribers call the `receive` message which will resubscribe.
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatApplication.java[tag=receive]
----
+
<1> Retrieve the `ChatMessage`
<2> Call a method to generate a string representation of the message and display it
<3> Commit the element so that we do not receive the message again
<4> Receive the next message

8. Generate a join message on startup
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatApplication.java[tag=join]
----
+

9. Send a public message when the user uses the `sendpm` command:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatApplication.java[tag=sendPublic]
----
+
<1> Asynchronously send the message and increment the messages sent when complete

10. Send a private message when the user uses the `sendpm` command:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatApplication.java[tag=sendPrivate]
----
+
<1> Asynchronously send the message and increment the messages sent when complete

11. Generate a leave message on exit and cleanup
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/com/oracle/coherence/guides/topics/ChatApplication.java[tag=cleanup]
----

[#run-the-example]
=== Build and Run the Example

Build the project using either of the following:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean package
----

or

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean build
----

1. Start one or more Coherence Cache Servers using the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw exec:exec -P server
----
+
or
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runServer
----

2. Start the first chat client with the user `Tim`
+
[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/topics-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Tim
----
+
or
+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runClient -PuserId=Tim --console=plain
----
+
You will notice output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
Oracle Coherence Version 20.12 Build demo
 Grid Edition: Development mode
Copyright (c) 2000, 2021, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

User: Tim
Commands:
quit - Quit the chat
help - Display help
send - Send public message
sendpm userId - Send private message

Chat (Tim)>
----

3. Start a second second client with the name `Helen`. You will see a message on `Tim's` chat application indicating `Helen` has joined the chat.
+
[source,bash]
----
Chat (Tim)> 14:14:30 Helen joined the chat
----

4. Use `send hello` from `Helen's` chat and you will notice that the message is dispalyed on `Tim's` chat.

5. To show how subscriber groups work, send a private message using the following from `Tim` to `JK`.
+
[source,bash]
----
Chat (Tim)> sendpm JK Hello JK
----
+
Also send a private message to `admin`.
+
[source,bash]
----
Chat (Tim)> sendpm admin Please ping me when you get in as i have an issue with my Laptop
----

6. Start a third chat application with `JK` as the user:
+
[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/topics-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar JK

User: JK
Commands:
quit - Quit the chat
help - Display help
send - Send public message
sendpm userId - Send private message

Chat (JK)>
----
+
NOTE: You will notice that the private message for `JK` was not delivered as the subscriber group `JK` was
only created when he joined and therefore messages send previously are not stored.
+
NOTE: You will also see join messages on the other terminals.

7. Type `quit` in `Helen's` terminal and restart the client as `admin`
+
[source,bash]
----
java -jar target/topics-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar admin

User: admin
Commands:
quit - Quit the chat
help - Display help
send - Send public message
sendpm userId - Send private message

Chat (admin)> 14:18:29 Tim (Private) - Please ping me when you get in as i have an issue with my Laptop
----
+
NOTE: You will notice that the message sent before `admin` joined is now delivered as the `admin` subscriber group was
created in configuration and add on server startup.

8. Type a message `send Got to go, bye` on `JK's` chat application and then `quit`. The message
along with the leave notification will be shown on the other terminals.
+
[source,bash]
----
Chat (JK)> send Got to go, bye
----

9. Now that `JK` has quit the application, send a private message from `Tim` to `JK` using `sendpm JK please ping me`.
+
[source,bash]
----
Chat (Tim)> sendpm JK please ping me
----

10. Start the client as `JK` and you will see the message displayed now as the subscriber group is created.

11. Finally send a private messge from `Tim` to `admin` using `sendpm admin Are you free for lunch?`.
You will notice this message is only displayed for `admin`.
+
[source,bash]
----
Chat (Tim)> sendpm admin Are you free for lunch?
----
