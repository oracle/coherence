/**
 * The context class is intended to be a statefull class shared across a single execution. Its main
 * purpose is to hold local data and to pass it to others contributors of the
 * serialization/deserialization chain.
 * <p/>
 * For example if you have computed in a first serializer a value and you need it later in another
 * one, you can put it in the context by using {@link Context#store(String, Object)} method and
 * later retrieve it with {@link #get(String, Class)} or remove it with {@link #remove(String, Class)}.
 * <p/>
 * You can achieve the same thing with {@link ThreadLocalHolder} that stores the data in a thread
 * local map but it is cleaner to use this Context class as you wont have to worry about removing
 * values from it. Indeed java web servers reuse created threads, so if you store data in a thread
 * local variable and don't remove it, it will still be present when another request comes in and is
 * bound to that thread! This can also lead to memory leaks! Don't forget the
 * try-store-finally-remove block if you stick with ThreadLocalHolder.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * This class stores also the views present in the current context, those views will be applied to
 * the matching objects during serialization and deserialization.
