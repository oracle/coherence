/**
 * A Bus represents a communication mechanism that allows the exchange of
 * information between multiple peers, called EndPoints.
 * <p>
 * Communication with another peer requires a connection. The boundaries of a
 * connection are identified by a pair of CONNECT and RELEASE events. Unless
 * otherwise specified, all operations occurring within a connection between
 * the two peers are ordered based upon the order in which they were invoked
 * upon the source bus.
 * <p>
 * Bus operations taking receipts are asynchronous. Completion of asynchronous
 * operations is identified via a corresponding {@link Event.Type#RECEIPT
 * RECEIPT} event {@link #setEventCollector(Collector)}
 * arriving locally} prior to any {@link Event.Type#DISCONNECT DISCONNECT}
 * event for the same peer. Any RECEIPT event arriving after the DISCONNECT
 * event indicates an operation which is not known to have completed.
 * Completion of an operation indicates that the operation reached the peer
 * and is ready for processing. As operations are ordered this also indicates
 * that all prior operations reached the peer as well. Note RECEIPT events are
 * not provided for <tt>null</tt> receipts but can be inferred from a RECEIPT
 * event for a subsequent operation against the same peer.
 * <p>
 * Invoking an asynchronous operation may not result in the operation being
 * immediately dispatched to the peer. The dispatch is only ensured once
 * a call to {@link #flush flush()} is issued. The general usage pattern would
 * be to perform a series of asynchronous operations, followed by a call to
 * flush.
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise noted all bus operations are thread-safe and all
 * asynchronous bus operations are re-entrant, i.e. may be issued from
 * within a collector callback.
