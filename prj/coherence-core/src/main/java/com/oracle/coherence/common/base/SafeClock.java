/**
 * SafeClock maintains a "safe" time in milliseconds.
 * <p>
 * Unlike the {@link System#currentTimeMillis()} this clock guarantees that
 * the time never "goes back". More specifically, when queried twice on the
 * same thread, the second query will never return a value that is less then
 * the value returned by the first.
 * <p>
 * If it is detected that the system clock moved backward, an attempt will be
 * made to gradually compensate the safe clock (by slowing it down), so in the
 * long run the safe time is the same as the system time.
 * <p>
 * The SafeClock supports the concept of "clock jitter", which is a small
 * time interval that the system clock could fluctuate by without a
 * corresponding passage of wall time.
 * <p>
 * In most cases the {@link SafeClock#INSTANCE} singleton should be used
 * rather then creating new SafeClock instances.
