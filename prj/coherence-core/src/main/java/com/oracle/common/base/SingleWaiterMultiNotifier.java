/**
 * A Condition-like object, used by a single thread to block for a
 * notification, and optimized for many concurrent notifications by other
 * threads. Basically, this is a blocking queue without any state to
 * actually enqueue: the {@link SingleWaiterMultiNotifier#await()} method
 * is analogous to an imaginary "take all" variant of the
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue#take() BlockingQueue.take()}
 * method, and the
 * {@link SingleWaiterMultiNotifier#signal()} method is analogous to
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue#put(Object)
 * BlockingQueue.put()}.
 * <p>
 * Note that no synchronization is needed to use this class; i.e. clients
 * must not synchronize on this class prior to calling <tt>await()</tt> or
 * <tt>signal()</tt>, nor should the use any of the primitive <tt>wait()</tt>
 * or <tt>notify()</tt> methods.
 * <p>
 * Since SingleWaiterMultiNotifier is only usable by a single waiting thread it is
 * does not require an external readiness check, as signaling can record that state.
