/**
 * An opaque representation of the position of an element within a channel of a topic.
 * <p>
 * The exact implementation of a {@link Position} is dependent on the {@link NamedTopic}
 * implementation.
 * <p>
 * Positions are {@link Comparable} so that topic elements can be compared to find
 * their relative positions to one another.
 * <p>
 * Positions are serializable, so they can be stored and recovered in their binary serialized format,
 * which is useful for use-cases where the state of processing of specific topic elements needs
 * to be tracked and stored in a third-party data store (such as a {@link com.tangosol.net.NamedMap}
 * or database).
