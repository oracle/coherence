/**
 * NonBlockingEntryStore provides a means to integrate Coherence with an underlying
 * data source that offers a non-blocking API.
 * <p>
 * The methods on this interface a called based on a get, getAll, put, putAll, remove
 * or removeAll respectively. Similar to {@link BinaryEntryStore}, the methods on this
 * interface receive a BinaryEntry allowing them to avoid deserialization, if possible,
 * for the key, value and original value by using the {@code get*Binary*} equivalent
 * methods.
 * <p>
 * The expectation is for implementations to execute non-blocking APIs that will complete
 * at some point in the future. Once the operation completes the implementation can
 * notify the provided {@link StoreObserver} via {@link StoreObserver#onNext onNext} or
 * {@link StoreObserver#onError onError} passing the <b>same</b> BinaryEntry that was
 * provided which correlates to the successful or unsuccessful operation. Additionally,
 * the {@link StoreObserver} offers an {@link StoreObserver#onComplete onComplete} method to allow
 * an implementation to suggest to Coherence that no further processing will occur for the
 * relevant operation. Below is an example implementation:
 * <pre><code>
 *   public void loadAll(Set&lt;? extends BinaryEntry&lt;K, V>> setBinEntries, StoreObserver&lt;K, V> observer)
 *       {
 *       SomeReactiveResource resource;
 *       for (BinaryEntry&lt;K, V> binEntry : setBinEntries)
 *           {
 *           CompletableFuture&lt;V> future = resource.get(binEntry.getKey);
 *           future.whenComplete((value, exception) ->
 *               {
 *               if (exception == null)
 *                   {
 *                   binEntry.setValue(value);
 *                   observer.onNext(binEntry))
 *                   }
 *               else
 *                   {
 *                   observer.onError(binEntry, exception))
 *                   if (isTerminal(exception))
 *                       {
 *                       // no further processing will be possible as resource
 *                       // is terminally unavailable and assume futures will
 *                       // not be fired
 *                       observer.onComplete();
 *                       }
 *                   }
 *               }
 *           }
 *       }
 * </code></pre>
 * Some additional notes on calling {@link StoreObserver#onComplete()}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The StoreObserver instance will throw a IllegalStateException on
 *       any future calls to {@link StoreObserver#onNext onNext} or {@link StoreObserver#onError onError}.</li>
 *   <li>Any unprocessed entries will have their decorations removed thus store
 *       will not be called on failover</li>
 * </ul>
