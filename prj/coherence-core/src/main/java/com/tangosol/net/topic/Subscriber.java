/**
 * A {@link Subscriber} subscribes either directly to a {@link NamedTopic} or to a {@link NamedTopic#getSubscriberGroups()
 * subscriber group} of a {@link NamedTopic}. Each value published to a {@link NamedTopic} is delivered to all of its
 * {@link NamedTopic#getSubscriberGroups() subscriber groups} and direct (anonymous) {@link Subscriber}s.
 * <p>
 * The factory methods {@link NamedTopic#createSubscriber(Subscriber.Option[])} or
 * {@link com.tangosol.net.Session#createSubscriber(String, Option[])}
 * allows one to specify one or more {@link Subscriber.Option}s to configure the {@link Subscriber}.
 * The {@link Subscriber.Name#inGroup(String)} option specifies the subscriber group for the {@link Subscriber} to join.
 * If this option is not specified, the {@link Subscriber} is a direct (anonymous) subscriber to the topic.
 * All Subscriber options and defaults are summarized in a table in {@link Option}.
 *
 * <h3>Channels</h3>
 * Topics use the concept of channels to improve scalability. This is similar to how Coherence uses partition for caches
 * but to avoid confusion the name channel was chosen. The default is the next prime above the square root of the
 * partition count configured for the underlying cache service, which for the default partition count of 257 is 17
 * channels.
 * <p>
 * {@link Publisher Publishers} publish messages to a channel based on their ordering configuration. Subscribers then
 * subscribe from channels by assigning channel ownership to subscribers. An anonymous subscriber has ownership of all
 * channels. A subscriber that is part of a subscriber group has ownership of a sub-set of the available channels.
 * <p>
 * Channel count is configurable, but ideally should not be set too high nor too low. For example setting the channel
 * count to 1, would mean that all publishers contend to publish to a single channel, and that only one subscriber
 * in a subscriber group will be able to receive messages. Setting the channel count too high (above say the number of
 * publishers) may mean that some channels never receive any messages and are wasted. Finding the appropriate value is
 * admittedly non-trivial, however when faced with maxing out throughput from a publisher's perspective this is a
 * configuration that can be tweaked.
 *
 * <h3>Subscriber Groups</h3>
 * Subscribers can be part of a subscriber group. Within each subscriber group, each value is only
 * {@link #receive() received} by one of the {@link Subscriber group members}, enabling distributed, parallel
 * processing of the values delivered to the subscriber group. Thus, each subscriber group in effect behaves like a
 * queue over the topic data.
 * <p>
 * Subscribers in a group can be considered durable, if they are closed, or fail, then message processing will continue
 * from the next element after the last committed position when subscriber reconnect.
 * <p>
 * To maintain ordering or messages, only a single subscriber in a group polls for messages from a channel.
 * Each subscriber in a group is allocated ownership of a sub-set of the channels in a topic. This means that
 * the maximum number of subscribers in a group that could be doing any work would be the same as the topic's
 * channel count. If there are more subscribers in a group that there are channels, then the additional subscribers
 * will not be allocated ownership of any channels and hence will receive no messages.
 * It may seem that increasing the channel count to a higher number would therefore allow more subscribers to work in
 * parallel, but this is not necessarily the case.
 * <p>
 * Channels are allocated to subscribers when they are created. As more subscribers in a group are created channel
 * ownership is rebalanced, existing subscribers may lose ownership of channels that are allocated to new subscribers.
 * As subscribers are {@link Subscriber#close() closed} (or die or are timed out), again channel ownership is rebalanced
 * over the remaining subscribers.
 * <p>
 * Subscribers in a group have a configurable timeout. If a subscriber does not call receive within the timeout it is
 * considered dead and the channels it owns will be reallocated to other subscribers in the group. This is to stop
 * channel starvation where no subscriber in a group is polling from a channel.
 *
 * <h3>Positions</h3>
 * Elements in a {@link NamedTopic} are published to a channel have a unique {@link Position} within that channel.
 * A {@link Position} is an opaque representation of the underlying position as theoretically the implementation of
 * the {@link Position} could change for different types of topic. Positions are used in various places in the API,
 * for example, positions can be committed, and they can be used to move the subscriber to back or forwards within
 * a channel. A {@link Position} is serializable, so they can be stored and recovered to later reset a subscriber
 * to a desired position. Positions are {@link Comparable} so positions for elements can be used to determine whether
 * how two elements related to each other within a channel.
 *
 * <h3>Committing</h3>
 * Subscribers in a group are durable, so if they disconnect and reconnect, messages processing will restart from the
 * correct position.
 * A Subscriber can {@link Element#commit() commit an element} or {@link Subscriber#commit(int, Position) commit a
 * position in a channel}. After a successful commit, then on reconnection the first message received from a channel
 * will be <i>the next message <b>after</b> the committed position</i>.
 * <p>
 * When a position is committed, this will also commit any earlier positions in the channel. For example, if
 * five elements are received and commit is called only on the last element, this effectively also commits the previous
 * four elements.
 * <p>
 * When topics are configured not to retain elements, received elements will be removed as they are committed by
 * subscribers.
 * <p>
 * If a subscriber in a subscriber group is timed-out (or dies) and its channel ownership is reallocated to other
 * subscribers in the group, those subscribers will start to receive messages from the last committed position for
 * of the channels from the failed subscriber.
 * <p>
 * Commits may be performed synchronously (using {@link #commit(int, Position)}) or asynchronously (using
 * {@link #commitAsync(int, Position)}). There is no facility for automatic commit of messages, all calls
 * to commit <i>must</i> be done manually by application code.
 *
 * <h3>Seeking</h3>
 * A new subscriber will start to receive message from the head position of a channel (or the last committed position
 * for a durable subscriber) and continue to receive messages in order until the tail is reached.
 * It is possible to reposition a subscriber (backwards or forwards) using one of the {@link #seek(int, Instant)}
 * methods. Seeking applies a new position to a specific channel. If an attempt is made to position the channel before
 * the first available message (the channel's head) then the subscriber will be positioned at the head.
 * Correspondingly, if an attempt is made to position a subscriber way beyond the last position in a channel
 * (the channel's tail) then the subscriber will be positioned at the tail of the channel and will receive the
 * next message published to that channel.
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to seek to a timestamp. Published messages are given a timestamp, which is the
 * {@link com.tangosol.net.Cluster#getTimeMillis() Coherence cluster time} on the storage enabled cluster member that
 * accepted the published message. Using the {@link #seek(int, Instant)} method a subscriber can be repositioned so that
 * the next message received from a channel is the first message with a timestamp <i>greater than</i> the timestamp
 * used in the seek call. For example to position channel 0 so that the next message received is the first message after
 * 20:30 on July 5th 2021:
 * <pre>
 *     Instant timestamp = LocalDateTime.of(2021, Month.JULY, 5, 20, 30)
 *             .toInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC);
 *     subscriber.seek(0, timestamp);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h4>Seeking Forwards</h4>
 * It is important to note that seeking forwards is skipping over messages, those skipped message will never
 * be received once another commit is executed. Moving forwards does not alter the commit position, so when a
 * subscriber has committed a position, then moves forwards and later fails, it will restart back at the commit.
 *
 * <h4>Seeking Backwards Over Previous Commits</h4>
 * When topics are configured not to retain elements removal of elements occurs as their positions are committed, so
 * they can never be received again.
 * This means that in this case, it would not be possible to seek backwards further than the last commit, as those
 * elements no longer exist in the topic.
 * <p>
 * When topics are configured to retain elements then it is possible to seek backwards further than the last commit.
 * This effectively rolls-back those commits and the previously committed messages after the new seek position will
 * be re-received. If a subscriber fails after moving back in this fashion it will restart at the rolled-back position.
 *
 * <h3>Receiving Elements</h3>
 * Receiving elements from a topic is an asynchronous operation, calls to {@link #receive()} (or the batch
 * version {@link #receive(int)}) return a {@link CompletableFuture}. If multiple calls are made to receive,
 * the returned futures will complete in the correct order to maintain message ordering in a channel.
 * To maintain ordering, the futures are completed by a single daemon thread. This means that code using
 * any of the synchronous {@link CompletableFuture} handling patterns, such as
 * {@link CompletableFuture#thenApply(java.util.function.Function)} or
 * {@link CompletableFuture#thenAccept(java.util.function.Consumer)}, etc. will run on
 * the same daemon thread, so application code in the handler methods must complete before the next receive future
 * will be completed. Again, this is intentional, to maintain strict ordering of processing of received elements.
 * If the {@link CompletableFuture} asynchronous handler methods are used such as,
 * {@link CompletableFuture#thenApplyAsync(java.util.function.Function)}
 * or {@link CompletableFuture#thenAcceptAsync(java.util.function.Consumer)}, etc.
 * then the application code handling the received element will execute on another thread, and at this point there
 * are no ordering guarantees.
 * <p>
 * It is important that application code uses the correct handling of the returned futures to both maintain
 * ordering (if that is important to the application) and also to have correct error handling, and not lose exceptions,
 * which is easy to do in poorly written asynchronous future handler code.
 *
 * <h3>Clean-Up</h3>
 * Subscribers should ideally be closed when application code finishes with them. This will clean up server-side
 * resources associated with a subscriber.
 * <p>
 * It is also important (possibly more important) to {@link NamedTopic#destroySubscriberGroup(String) clean up
 * subscriber groups} that are no longer required. Failure to delete a subscriber group will cause messages to be
 * retained on the server that would otherwise have been removed, so consuming more server-side resources such as
 * heap and disc.
