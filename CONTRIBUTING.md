## Contributing to the Oracle Coherence Community Edition repository

Pull requests can be made under
[The Oracle Contributor Agreement](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/oca-486395.html) (OCA).

For pull requests to be accepted, the bottom of your commit message must have
the following line using your name and e-mail address as it appears in the
OCA Signatories list.

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>
```

This can be automatically added to pull requests by committing with:

```

```

Only pull requests from committers that can be verified as having
signed the OCA can be accepted.

### Pull request process

1. Fork this repository
1. Create a branch in your fork to implement the changes. We recommend using
the issue number as part of your branch name, e.g. `1234-fixes`
1. Ensure that all changes comply to project coding conventions
1. Ensure that there is at least one test that would fail without the fix and
passes post fix
1. Ensure that a full verify build passes without **any** test failures
1. Submit the pull request. *Do not leave the pull request blank*. Explain exactly
what your changes are meant to do and provide simple steps on how to validate
your changes, ideally referencing the test. Ensure that you reference the issue
you created as well. We will assign the pull request to 2-3 people for review
before it is merged.
