<p>The source code for the guides and tutorials can be found in the
<a id="" title="" target="_blank" href="http://github.com/oracle/coherence/tree/master/prj/examples">Coherence CE GitHub repo</a></p>

<p>The example source code is structured as both a Maven and a Gradle project and can be easily built with either
of those build tools. The examples are stand-alone projects so each example can be built from the
specific project directory without needing to build the whole Coherence project.</p>
