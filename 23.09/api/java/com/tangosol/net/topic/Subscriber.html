<div class="block">A <a href="Subscriber.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Subscriber</code></a> subscribes either directly to a <a href="NamedTopic.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>NamedTopic</code></a> or to a <a href="NamedTopic.html#getSubscriberGroups()"><code>subscriber group</code></a> of a <a href="NamedTopic.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>NamedTopic</code></a>.

 <a href="NamedTopic.html#getSubscriberGroups()"><code>subscriber groups</code></a> and direct (anonymous) <a href="Subscriber.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Subscriber</code></a>s.
 <p>
 The factory methods <a href="NamedTopic.html#createSubscriber(com.tangosol.net.topic.Subscriber.Option...)"><code>NamedTopic.createSubscriber(Subscriber.Option[])</code></a> or
 <a href="../Session.html#createSubscriber(java.lang.String,com.tangosol.net.topic.Subscriber.Option...)"><code>Session.createSubscriber(String, Option[])</code></a>
 allows one to specify one or more <a href="Subscriber.Option.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Subscriber.Option</code></a>s to configure the <a href="Subscriber.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Subscriber</code></a>.
 The <a href="Subscriber.Name.html#inGroup(java.lang.String)"><code>Subscriber.Name.inGroup(String)</code></a> option specifies the subscriber group for the <a href="Subscriber.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Subscriber</code></a> to join.
 If this option is not specified, the <a href="Subscriber.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Subscriber</code></a> is a direct (anonymous) subscriber to the topic.
 All Subscriber options and defaults are summarized in a table in <a href="Subscriber.Option.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Subscriber.Option</code></a>.

 <h3 id="channels-heading">Channels</h3>
 Topics use the concept of channels to improve scalability. This is similar to how Coherence uses partition for caches
 but to avoid confusion the name channel was chosen. The default is the next prime above the square root of the
 partition count configured for the underlying cache service, which for the default partition count of 257 is 17
 channels.
 <p>
 <a href="Publisher.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Publishers</code></a> publish messages to a channel based on their ordering configuration. Subscribers then
 subscribe from channels by assigning channel ownership to subscribers. An anonymous subscriber has ownership of all
 channels. A subscriber that is part of a subscriber group has ownership of a sub-set of the available channels.
 <p>
 Channel count is configurable, but ideally should not be set too high nor too low. For example setting the channel
 count to 1, would mean that all publishers contend to publish to a single channel, and that only one subscriber
 in a subscriber group will be able to receive messages. Setting the channel count too high (above say the number of
 publishers) may mean that some channels never receive any messages and are wasted. Finding the appropriate value is
 admittedly non-trivial, however when faced with maxing out throughput from a publisher's perspective this is a
 configuration that can be tweaked.

 <h3 id="subscriber-groups-heading">Subscriber Groups</h3>
 Subscribers can be part of a subscriber group. Within each subscriber group, each value is only
 <a href="#receive()"><code>received</code></a> by one of the <a href="Subscriber.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>group members</code></a>, enabling distributed, parallel
 processing of the values delivered to the subscriber group. Thus, each subscriber group in effect behaves like a
 queue over the topic data.
 <p>
 Subscribers in a group can be considered durable, if they are closed, or fail, then message processing will continue
 from the next element after the last committed position when subscriber reconnect.
 <p>
 To maintain ordering or messages, only a single subscriber in a group polls for messages from a channel.
 Each subscriber in a group is allocated ownership of a sub-set of the channels in a topic. This means that
 the maximum number of subscribers in a group that could be doing any work would be the same as the topic's
 channel count. If there are more subscribers in a group that there are channels, then the additional subscribers
 will not be allocated ownership of any channels and hence will receive no messages.
 It may seem that increasing the channel count to a higher number would therefore allow more subscribers to work in
 parallel, but this is not necessarily the case.
 <p>
 Channels are allocated to subscribers when they are created. As more subscribers in a group are created channel
 ownership is rebalanced, existing subscribers may lose ownership of channels that are allocated to new subscribers.
 As subscribers are <a href="#close()"><code>closed</code></a> (or die or are timed out), again channel ownership is rebalanced
 over the remaining subscribers.
 <p>
 Subscribers in a group have a configurable timeout. If a subscriber does not call receive within the timeout it is
 considered dead and the channels it owns will be reallocated to other subscribers in the group. This is to stop
 channel starvation where no subscriber in a group is polling from a channel.

 <h3 id="positions-heading">Positions</h3>
 Elements in a <a href="NamedTopic.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>NamedTopic</code></a> are published to a channel have a unique <a href="Position.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Position</code></a> within that channel.
 A <a href="Position.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Position</code></a> is an opaque representation of the underlying position as theoretically the implementation of
 the <a href="Position.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Position</code></a> could change for different types of topic. Positions are used in various places in the API,
 for example, positions can be committed, and they can be used to move the subscriber to back or forwards within
 a channel. A <a href="Position.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Position</code></a> is serializable, so they can be stored and recovered to later reset a subscriber
 to a desired position. Positions are <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html" title="class or interface in java.lang" class="external-link"><code>Comparable</code></a> so positions for elements can be used to determine whether
 how two elements related to each other within a channel.

 <h3 id="committing-heading">Committing</h3>
 Subscribers in a group are durable, so if they disconnect and reconnect, messages processing will restart from the
 correct position.
 A Subscriber can <a href="Subscriber.Element.html#commit()"><code>commit an element</code></a> or <a href="#commit(int,com.tangosol.net.topic.Position)"><code>commit a
 position in a channel</code></a>. After a successful commit, then on reconnection the first message received from a channel
 will be <i>the the next message <b>after</b> the committed position</i>.
 <p>
 When a position is committed, this will also commit any earlier positions in the channel. For example, if
 five elements are received and commit is called only on the last element, this effectively also commits the previous
 four elements.
 <p>
 When topics are configured not to retain elements, received elements will be removed as they are committed by
 subscribers.
 <p>
 If a subscriber in a subscriber group is timed-out (or dies) and its channel ownership is reallocated to other
 subscribers in the group, those subscribers will start to receive messages from the last committed position for
 of the channels from the failed subscriber.
 <p>
 Commits may be performed synchronously (using <a href="#commit(int,com.tangosol.net.topic.Position)"><code>commit(int, Position)</code></a>) or asynchronously (using
 <a href="#commitAsync(int,com.tangosol.net.topic.Position)"><code>commitAsync(int, Position)</code></a>). There is no facility for automatic commit of messages, all calls
 to commit <i>must</i> be done manually by application code.

 <h3 id="seeking-heading">Seeking</h3>
 A new subscriber will start to receive message from the head position of a channel (or the last committed position
 for a durable subscriber) and continue to receive messages in order until the tail is reached.
 It is possible to reposition a subscriber (backwards or forwards) using one of the <a href="#seek(int,java.time.Instant)"><code>seek(int, Instant)</code></a>
 methods. Seeking applies a new position to a specific channel. If an attempt is made to position the channel before
 the first available message (the channel's head) then the subscriber will be positioned at the head.
 Correspondingly, if an attempt is made to position a subscriber way beyond the last position in a channel
 (the channel's tail) then the subscriber will be positioned at the tail of the channel and will receive the
 next message published to that channel.
 <p>
 It is also possible to seek to a timestamp. Published messages are given a timestamp, which is the
 <a href="../Cluster.html#getTimeMillis()"><code>Coherence cluster time</code></a> on the storage enabled cluster member that
 accepted the published message. Using the <a href="#seek(int,java.time.Instant)"><code>seek(int, Instant)</code></a> method a subscriber can be repositioned so that
 the next message received from a channel is the first message with a timestamp <i>greater than</i> the timestamp
 used in the seek call. For example to position channel 0 so that the next message received is the first message after
 20:30 on July 5th 2021:
 <pre>
     Instant timestamp = LocalDateTime.of(2021, Month.JULY, 5, 20, 30)
             .toInstant(ZoneOffset.UTC);
     subscriber.seek(0, timestamp);
 </pre>

 <h4 id="seeking-forwards-heading">Seeking Forwards</h4>
 It is important to note that seeking forwards is skipping over messages, those skipped message will never
 be received once another commit is executed. Moving forwards does not alter the commit position, so when a
 subscriber has committed a position, then moves forwards and later fails, it will restart back at the commit.

 <h4 id="seeking-backwards-over-previous-commits-heading">Seeking Backwards Over Previous Commits</h4>
 When topics are configured not to retain elements removal of elements occurs as their positions are committed, so
 they can never be received again.
 This means that in this case, it would not be possible to seek backwards further than the last commit, as those
 elements no longer exist in the topic.
 <p>
 When topics are configured to retain elements then it is possible to seek backwards further than the last commit.
 This effectively rolls-back those commits and the previously committed messages after the new seek position will
 be re-received. If a subscriber fails after moving back in this fashion it will restart at the rolled-back position.

 <h3 id="receiving-elements-heading">Receiving Elements</h3>
 Receiving elements from a topic is an asynchronous operation, calls to <a href="#receive()"><code>receive()</code></a> (or the batch
 version <a href="#receive(int)"><code>receive(int)</code></a>) return a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent" class="external-link"><code>CompletableFuture</code></a>. If multiple calls are made to receive,
 the returned futures will complete in the correct order to maintain message ordering in a channel.
 To maintain ordering, the futures are completed by a single daemon thread. This means that code using
 any of the synchronous <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent" class="external-link"><code>CompletableFuture</code></a> handling patterns, such as
 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#thenApply(java.util.function.Function)" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent" class="external-link"><code>CompletableFuture.thenApply(java.util.function.Function)</code></a> or
 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#thenAccept(java.util.function.Consumer)" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent" class="external-link"><code>CompletableFuture.thenAccept(java.util.function.Consumer)</code></a>, etc. will run on
 the same daemon thread, so application code in the handler methods must complete before the next receive future
 will be completed. Again, this is intentional, to maintain strict ordering of processing of received elements.
 If the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent" class="external-link"><code>CompletableFuture</code></a> asynchronous handler methods are used such as,
 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#thenApplyAsync(java.util.function.Function)" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent" class="external-link"><code>CompletableFuture.thenApplyAsync(java.util.function.Function)</code></a>
 or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#thenAcceptAsync(java.util.function.Consumer)" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent" class="external-link"><code>CompletableFuture.thenAcceptAsync(java.util.function.Consumer)</code></a>, etc.
 then the application code handling the received element will execute on another thread, and at this point there
 are no ordering guarantees.
 <p>
 It is important that application code uses the correct handling of the returned futures to both maintain
 ordering (if that is important to the application) and also to have correct error handling, and not lose exceptions,
 which is easy to do in poorly written asynchronous future handler code.

 <h3 id="clean-up-heading">Clean-Up</h3>
 Subscribers should ideally be closed when application code finishes with them. This will clean up server-side
 resources associated with a subscriber.
 <p>
 It is also important (possibly more important) to <a href="NamedTopic.html#destroySubscriberGroup(java.lang.String)"><code>clean up
 subscriber groups</code></a> that are no longer required. Failure to delete a subscriber group will cause messages to be
 retained on the server that would otherwise have been removed, so consuming more server-side resources such as
 heap and disc.</div>

<h3>heartbeat</h3>
<div class="member-signature"><span class="return-type">void</span>&nbsp;<span class="element-name">heartbeat</span>()</div>
<div class="block">Send a heartbeat to the server to keep this subscriber alive.
 <p>
 Heartbeat messages are sent on calls to any of the <a href="#receive()"><code>receive()</code></a> methods.
 If a subscriber does not call receive within the configured timeout time, it will be considered dead
 and lose its channel ownership. This is to stop badly behaving subscribers from blocking messages
 from being processed, for example if a bug in application code causes a subscriber to deadlock or take
 an excessive amount of time to process messages.
 <p>
 If application code knows that it will take longer to execute than the subscriber timeout, for example
 the message processing communicates with a third-party system that is in some kind of back-off loop, then
 the subscriber can send a heartbeat to keep itself alive.
 <p>
 A subscriber that times-out is still active and is not closed. On the next call to a <a href="#receive()"><code>receive()</code></a> method
 the subscriber will reconnect and be reallocated channel ownerships. Although a timed-out subscriber is not
 closed it would have lost ownership of channels and not be able to commit any messages that it was processing
 when it timed out. This is because another subscriber in the group may have already been allocated ownership of
 the same channels, already processed, and committed that same message. Allowing commits of unowned channels
 is configurable, by default a subscriber can only commit positions for channels it owns.
 <p>
 Heart-beating only applies to subscribers that are members of a subscriber group. An anonymous subscriber
 owns all channels and no other subscriber is sharing the workload, so anonymous subscriber will not be
 timed-out. For an anonymous subscriber the heartbeat operation is a no-op.</div>

<div class="block">Seek to a position in a channel based the published timestamp of the elements in the topic.
 <p>
 This method will position the subscriber such that the element returned by the next call to any
 <code>receive</code> method that polls the specific channel will be the element with a published timestamp
 <i>after</i> the specified timestamp. The published timestamp is the
 <a href="../Cluster.html#getTimeMillis()"><code>cluster timestamp</code></a> on the member receiving the published
 element at the time the publish request was accepted.
 <p>
 An attempt to move the position using a timestamp later that the timestamp of the current tail position for

 <p>
 An attempt to move the position using a timestamp earlier than the current head position for the channel will
 reposition the channel at the head, effectively moving the subscriber back to the first available element in
 the channel.
 <p>
 Repositioning a channel ahead of its current position will skip unread elements in that channel.
 It will not move the last committed position for the channel, so if the subscriber is disconnected
 then it will restart at the previous commit.
 To also move the committed position a subsequent call to <a href="#commit(int,com.tangosol.net.topic.Position)"><code>commit(int, Position)</code></a>
 using the seeked to <a href="Position.html" title="interface in com.tangosol.net.topic"><code>Position</code></a> for the channel returned by this method will be required.
 <p>
 Repositioning a channel back before the current committed position will move the committed position for
 the channel back to the seeked position (i.e. back to the position returned from this method) effectively
 rolling back commits made to elements in the channel after the seeked.
